###A Bluetooth Smart (BTLE) distance tracker for wallet, keys, handbag and smartphone.###

This are the remnants of the android part of my master thesis project from November 2013. Using BTLE for the first time on the very new Android 4.3 of the time. Slightly ported to Android Studio in June 2015. BTLE on Android has improved since then and this project should not be used as a reference anymore.
